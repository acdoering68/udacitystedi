This is my submission for project 3 of the udacity course "Data Engineering with AWS". 
The code not of much use elsewhere. 
Because of the rules, other participants of the course should not use it either. 
Many parts of the code are generated by the AWS Glue system based on graphical input. 
Part of description is covered by the course. 
So it is not clear to me who owns the copyright. 

There are three datasets from here:
nd027-Data-Engineering-Data-Lakes-AWS-Exercises

In multiple stages the datasets  get cleaned up and joined to form final data for machine learning.
